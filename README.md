# Python Asteroids Game

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Asteroids game. The game involves controlling a spaceship in an asteroid field, where the objective is to destroy the asteroids and survive for as long as possible.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Navigate your spaceship, shoot asteroids, and avoid collisions to survive.
- **Simple Controls**: Use the arrow keys to maneuver the spaceship and the spacebar to shoot.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of your score as you destroy asteroids.
- **Basic Graphics**: The game uses basic graphics to recreate the retro feel of the original Asteroids game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the game, you'll need Python installed on your system along with the `pygame` library.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/joseph-krohn/python-asteroids_game.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd python-asteroids_game
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the game:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Use the arrow keys to rotate the spaceship and move forward.
- **Spacebar**: Press the spacebar to shoot bullets at the asteroids.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main Python script that contains the game logic and runs the game.
- `asteroid.py`: A Python module that defines the asteroid objects and their behavior.
- `spaceship.py`: A Python module that defines the spaceship object and its behavior.
- `bullet.py`: A Python module that defines the bullets fired by the spaceship.
- `requirements.txt`: A file that lists the dependencies required to run the game.
